# 👋🏻 Hey there! I'm Andrew

## About Me
A CS grad from SDSU who loves building software and solving real-world problems. I’m always curious about how things work and love breaking down complex problems into simple, elegant code. My background includes mobile development, machine learning, and backend systems — and I’m currently working on an app that brings those areas together.
